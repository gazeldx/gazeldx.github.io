`How to config two accounts of github.com in one computer?`

You can do it by generating two `rsa pairs` (e.g.: `work_rsa and work_rsa.pub` for github work account and `id_rsa and id_rsa.pub` for your own account) 
{% highlight bash %}
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "work_email@my_company.com"
ssh -T git@github.com
{% endhighlight %}
