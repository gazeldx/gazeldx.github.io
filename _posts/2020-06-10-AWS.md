# Route 53 and CloudFront
Today I found my CloudFront respond 403 error.

This is the steps I debug the issue:
Step 1:
```shell script
dig something.example.com # This is helpful for debug network. Better than ping or netstat.
something.example.com. 299 IN	CNAME	ja726pnjlery77.cloudfront.net.
ja726pnjlery77.cloudfront.net. 59 IN	A	13.224.164.14
ja726pnjlery77.cloudfront.net. 59 IN	A	13.224.164.115
ja726pnjlery77.cloudfront.net. 59 IN	A	13.224.164.34
ja726pnjlery77.cloudfront.net. 59 IN	A	13.224.164.5
```

Step 2:
Open http://ondemand.simplyhired-qa.com/ in Chrome.

Then right click and click `Inspect -> Network`.

Then refresh page and click the `something.example.com` in Name.

Pay attention to the `Remote Address: 127.0.0.1:1087` in `Headers`.

Here `127.0.0.1:1087` is my browser's proxy. So I need to close the Proxy. 

Then refresh again. I found `99.84.199.33` which is not in the list I got in step 1.

So I switch to another Wifi and refresh again. I got the IP which is listed in the step 1.

# RDS
* [How to dump database to local from RDS](https://gist.github.com/syafiqfaiz/5273cd41df6f08fdedeb96e12af70e3b).
You need to [create database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/sql-createdatabase.html) before importing.
```shell
psql -d overwatch_qa -f overwatch_qa_20201218.sql
```

If you have created the `overwatch_qa` locally before, you can rename it by:
```shell
psql -h localhost -p 5432 --username postgres
```

```sql
ALTER DATABASE example_db RENAME TO example_db_new_name;
```
