# Relationships of Jira
## Issue type
* When a issue type is created, it is put into `default issue type schema` by default. 
* issue types has schema. Here I call it `issue_type_schema`.

## Issue type schema
* `issue_type_schema` is a group of issue types.
* `issue_types_schema` can be assigned to many projects, 
  but a project can only has one `issue_types_schema`.

## Project
* You can pick only one `issue_type_schema` for a project.

## Issue status
* Issue status is an attribute of issue. E.g: `Backlog`, `In progress` or `Done` are some of the predefined issue statuses.

## Workflow
* A workflow is a group of `issue statuses`. E.g: You can define a custom workflow only contains these three issue statuses.
* Jira has some predefined workflows.

`Issue statuses` are finally assigned to an `issue type` by assigning workflow to that issue type in a project (must under a project).

# Marketplace apps
## Time in status
* After you click install, it will ask you that it want to get some permissions from you.
* After installed, a post page will display.
