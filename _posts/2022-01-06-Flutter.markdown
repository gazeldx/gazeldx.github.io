# Installation
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos

```shell
cd ~/tools
unzip ~/Downloads/flutter_macos_2.8.1-stable.zip
vim ~/.zshrc # Add `export PATH="$PATH:~/tools/flutter/bin"` to this file. Then close and open a new terminal tab.
flutter doctor
```

# Editor
https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor

I use `Android Studio`.

When I open `Android Studio` the first time, I saw a pop-up window `Unable to access Android SDK add-on list`.
Then I set the Proxy to match my ShadowSocks configuration. Host name is `127.0.0.1`, port is `1087`. Then it works.
