## RESTful API
* The difference between method `PATCH` and `PUT` is that `PATCH` is for partial update, only the fields that need to be changed are sent in the request body.
`PUT` is used to replace the entire resource with a new representation, meaning that all the fields in the resource are send in the request body.
