# Slice

```go
for _, price := range prices[1:] {
    // this will change `prices`, but it will never affect the previous lines' `prices[1:]`
    prices = prices[:len(prices) - 1]
}

// The above code is equivelent to the following code:
prices2 := prices[1:]
for _, price := range prices2 {
    // this will change `prices`, but it will never affect the previous lines' `prices[1:]`
    prices = prices[:len(prices) - 1]
}
```
